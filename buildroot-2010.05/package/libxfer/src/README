TransferManager manages the download tasks by HTTP/BT/Xunlei.

TransferManger adds/creates a task to download resource by HTTP/BT/Xunlei. 
If a task is created OK, TranferManager returns task id for App to control the task. 
After the task is created, App can start, pause or close it. 
File to describe the status of the tasks is saved to continue downloading resource. 
Tasks are loaded from the file when system reboots. 

NOTE: Streaming Manager is not encapsulated by TransferManager now.
